--The Form is validated using Javascript. It will be validated when the submit button is clicked.
--An error message will be displayed mentioning what type of error occured preventing form submission.
--have commented each section about what the code does.
--Added placeholders.

Beautify
--Applied some CSS to beautify the form(not much due to limited time)
--Applied some CSS to make it responsive
--edited some styles which was already there which makes it look good. Example : Select input textbox style was different form the others.
----The Tiger type input field will be displayed only if the tiger check box is checked.

Testing
--I have tested the form so that all the validation is working properly and the form is not submitted unless the form is validated.
--Tested accross browsers -Microsoft Edge, Mozilla firefox, Chrome.
-- have used onclick event for tiger checkbox to make it work for ie browser.


-Took Extra time since I used Javascript instead of any of the Javascript Frameworks
-Couldn't do real time validation since I was using Javascript. Can use AngularJS which helps to do real time validation using two way data binidng property of angular.
-URL that I have used for reference.
